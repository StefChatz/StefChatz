## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m passionate about building open-source tools and exploring decentralized protocols.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on

- **[Mars Protocol App](https://app.marsprotocol.io)**  
  A Gen-3 DeFi leverage platform built around our innovative Credit Account system. Mars Protocol lets you:
  - Open a single “Credit Account” to manage collateral, borrowing, and multiple positions in one place  
  - Trade spot, margin, perpetual futures (perps), and participate in leveraged yield farming  
  - Cross-collateralize any supported asset and enjoy unified, cross-margined risk management  
  - Benefit from advanced features like looping strategies and managed vaults for both high-leverage traders and passive yield seekers  

- **[Delta-Mars](https://delta-mars.com)**  
  An early-stage, decentralized interface — a weekend project I built for deploying fully delta-neutral strategies on the Neutron chain via Mars Protocol’s Credit Manager. Delta-Mars empowers you to:
  - Automatically balance lending positions with short perp trades to neutralize price exposure  
  - Capture combined yield from lending APYs, perp funding rates, and incentive campaigns  
  - Navigate market skew dynamics and optimize funding rate arbitrage  
  - Seamlessly monitor and adjust your delta-neutral portfolio through a simple, intuitive UI
