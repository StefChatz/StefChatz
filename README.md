## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about building open-source tools and exploring decentralized protocols.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on

## Projects Designed, Developed and Led:

- **[Amber-Finance](https://amberfi.io)**  
  A sophisticated DeFi protocol focused on yield optimization and risk management. Amber Finance provides:
  - Advanced yield farming strategies with automated position management
  - Cross-protocol integrations for maximizing capital efficiency
  - Risk-adjusted returns through sophisticated hedging mechanisms
  - Comprehensive analytics and performance tracking tools
  - Developer-friendly APIs and SDK for protocol integrations
  - Institutional-grade security audits and battle-tested smart contracts
  
- **[Delta-Mars](https://delta-mars.com)**  
  An early-stage, decentralized interface - a weekend project I built for deploying fully delta-neutral strategies on the Neutron chain via Mars Protocol's Credit Manager. Delta-Mars empowers you to:
  - Automatically balance lending positions with short perp trades to neutralize price exposure  
  - Capture combined yield from lending APYs, perp funding rates, and incentive campaigns  
  - Navigate market skew dynamics and optimize funding rate arbitrage  
  - Seamlessly monitor and adjust your delta-neutral portfolio through a simple, intuitive UI  
  
- **[Lore-Capital](https://www.lore-capital.finance)**  
  A delta-neutral yield hedge fund delivering consistent, market-independent returns through sophisticated DeFi strategies. Current fund performance:
  - **Total Annualized Return:** 20% with 0.8% max drawdown
  - **Current AUM:** $42,532.72 
  - **Sharpe Ratio:** 14.35
  - **Strategy Focus:** Delta-neutral positioning across DeFi protocols to capture yield while minimizing directional market exposure
  - Institutional-grade risk management with real-time monitoring and automated rebalancing
  - Professional fund administration with transparent reporting and investor portal access

## Projects worked on as core contributor:

- **[Mars Protocol App](https://app.marsprotocol.io)**  
  A Gen-3 DeFi leverage platform built around our innovative Credit Account system. Mars Protocol lets you:
  - Open a single “Credit Account” to manage collateral, borrowing, and multiple positions in one place  
  - Trade spot, margin, perpetual futures (perps), and participate in leveraged yield farming  
  - Cross-collateralize any supported asset and enjoy unified, cross-margined risk management  
  - Benefit from advanced features like looping strategies and managed vaults for both high-leverage traders and passive yield seekers
